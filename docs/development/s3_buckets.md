# S3 Buckets

TheRock uses Amazon S3 buckets to store CI build outputs (artifacts, logs,
python packages, etc.) and release artifacts. This page lists all buckets
and explains the authentication needed to upload to them.

## Authentication

Most buckets require assuming an IAM role via
[`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
using OIDC. This requires `id-token: write` in the job's `permissions` block.
The full ARN pattern is
`arn:aws:iam::692859939525:role/therock-{ci,dev,nightly,prerelease}`.

```yaml
# This covers the common case for "CI" workflows that run on PRs from
# ROCm repositories and PRs from forks. Other workflows, such as release
# workflows also used by https://github.com/ROCm/rockrel, may use different
# roles and slightly different usage patterns.

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: azure-linux-scale-rocm
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    # Linux containers only — mount runner baseline credentials
    env:
      AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE: /home/awsconfig/credentials.ini

    steps:
      # ... build steps ...

      # Credentials are short-lived — assume the role close to when it's needed.

      # Assume the therock-ci OIDC role in ROCm/TheRock. Other repos
      # fall back to runner base credentials (therock-ci-artifacts-external).
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        if: ${{ github.repository == 'ROCm/TheRock' && !github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork }}
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@8df5847569e6427dd6c4fb1cf565c83acfa8afa7 # v6.0.0
        with:
          aws-region: us-east-2
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::692859939525:role/therock-ci
          # Windows only — retry until secret key has no special characters:
          special-characters-workaround: true

      # ... upload steps that use the credentials ...
```

**Platform-specific details:**

- **Linux containers** mount runner credentials via
  `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE: /home/awsconfig/credentials.ini` in the job's
  `env` block. These baseline credentials allow uploading to
  `therock-ci-artifacts-external` without OIDC.
- **Windows** jobs must pass `special-characters-workaround: true` to
  `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`. This retries credential fetching
  until the secret access key contains no special characters, which some
  Windows environments cannot tolerate.

## Bucket inventory

### CI buckets

Our CI runners come with baseline credentials that allow uploading to
`therock-ci-artifacts-external` without any extra setup. Workflows in
downstream repos like `rocm-libraries`, `rocm-systems`, and `llvm-project`
upload to this bucket and do not need `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`.

| Bucket                                                                                     | Contents                                | IAM role                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [`therock-ci-artifacts`](https://therock-ci-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/)                   | Build outputs for `ROCm/TheRock`        | `therock-ci`                                      |
| [`therock-ci-artifacts-external`](https://therock-ci-artifacts-external.s3.amazonaws.com/) | Build outputs for forks and other repos | `therock-ci-external`, or runner base credentials |

### Release buckets

Each release type (`dev`, `nightly`, `prerelease`, `release`) has a matching
set of buckets.

The `dev`, `nightly`, and `prerelease` types are accessed via
the `therock-{release_type}` IAM role while stable `release` buckets are
manually promoted from prereleases via IAM user policies (see
[`how_to_do_release.md`](/build_tools/packaging/how_to_do_release.md)).

Python, tarball, and native package buckets are fronted by CloudFront CDNs —
prefer the CDN URLs for reading (e.g. `pip install --index-url`).

### Legacy buckets

CI runs before 2025-11-11 ([TheRock #2046](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/2046))
used different bucket names. These are no longer written to but still contain
historical data. We may remove these once we implement a retention policy for
artifacts.
