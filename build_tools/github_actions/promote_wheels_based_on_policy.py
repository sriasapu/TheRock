Decide whether to upload/promote build artifacts in GitHub Actions.


Reads env vars BUILD_RESULT, TEST_RESULT, TEST_RUNS_ON, BYPASS_TESTS_FOR_RELEASES and
sets `upload` ("true"/"false") via `gha_set_env` using this policy:

2) test runner present and tests failed/skipped → false
3) no test runner and not bypassing → false
