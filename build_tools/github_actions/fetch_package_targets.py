"""This file helps generate a package target matrix for workflows.

Environment variable inputs:
    * 'AMDGPU_FAMILIES': A comma separated list of AMD GPU families, e.g.
                    `gfx94X,gfx103x`, or empty for the default list
    * 'THEROCK_PACKAGE_PLATFORM': "linux" or "windows"

Outputs written to GITHUB_OUTPUT:
    * 'package_targets': JSON list of the form
        [
            {
                "amdgpu_family": "gfx94X-dcgpu",
                "test_machine": "linux-mi300-1gpu-ossci-rocm",
