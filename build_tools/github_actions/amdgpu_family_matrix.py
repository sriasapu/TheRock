This AMD GPU Family Matrix is the "source of truth" for GitHub workflows.

* Each entry determines which families and test runners are available to use
* Each group determines which entries run by default on workflow triggers

For presubmit, postsubmit and nightly family selection:

- presubmit runs the targets from presubmit dictionary on pull requests
- postsubmit runs the targets from presubmit and postsubmit dictionaries on pushes to main branch
- nightly runs targets from presubmit, postsubmit and nightly dictionaries
